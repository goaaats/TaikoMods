## Configuration

After installing the mod, and running the game it will generate files in `.\BepInEx\config`. Open `com.fluto.taikomods.cfg` to configure this mod
Here you can enable each individual feature or redirect where custom songs will be loaded from


## Custom Songs

With this feature you can inject custom songs into the game!
To begin place custom songs in `SongDirectory` specified in your configuration file, by default this is `%userprofile%/Documents/TaikoTheDrumMasterMods/customSongs`
Each song must have it's own directory with a unique name. The folder must have this structure
```
CustomSongs
-- [MUSIC_ID]
---- data.json (this contains the metadata for the track)
---- song_[MUSIC_ID].bin (this is a raw .acb music file, this is a CRIWARE format)
---- [MUSIC_ID]_e.bin (all of these items below are unencrypted Fumens, which formats how the song is played)
---- [MUSIC_ID]_e_1.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_e_2.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_h.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_h_1.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_h_2.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_m.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_m_1.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_m_2.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_n.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_n_1.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_n_2.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_x.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_x_1.bin
---- [MUSIC_ID]_x_2.bin
```
This format will be updated in the future to remove redundantancy 
```
